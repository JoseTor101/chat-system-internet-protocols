# Introduction

This project aims to apply the concepts learned in the telematics course thus far. Building upon the TCP/IP model, this work focuses on the transport and application layers. The transport layer is implemented using the Berkeley sockets API [1], while the application layer is designed through a custom protocol developed by our team. The primary objective of this project is to implement a client-to-client chat system that later will be uploaded in AWS services.

# Objectives

- **Develop a client-server chat application:** Implement both the client and server sides using a custom communication protocol designed for this project.

- **Implement an application layer protocol:** Design and develop a robust protocol for transmitting text messages between the client and server, allowing for future extensibility.

- **Utilize the sockets API:** Communication between the client and server will be conducted using sockets, facilitating effective data transmission.

- **Support multiple concurrent connections:** The server must handle multiple client connections simultaneously, enabling different pairs of clients to communicate without interference.



# Development

For this activity, we chose to use TCP instead of UDP primarily due to its dedicated native error control. TCP ensures that packets arrive in the order they are sent, which is essential for maintaining the coherence of messages. This characteristic is crucial for ensuring a smooth and fluid conversation. Below is a comparative table that illustrates these differences in more detail.


### TCP vs UDP

| Factor                    | TCP                                                    | UDP                                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Connection Type**       | Requires a connection to be established before data transmission | No connection needed to start and end data transfer      |
| **Data Sequencing**       | Can sequence data (send in a specific order)          | Cannot sequence or order data                             |
| **Data Retransmission**   | Can retransmit data if packets do not arrive          | No retransmission of data. Lost data cannot be recovered  |
| **Delivery**              | Delivery is guaranteed                                  | Delivery is not guaranteed                                |
| **Error Checking**        | Extensive error checking ensures data arrives intact   | Basic error checking may not catch all errors            |
| **Broadcasting**          | Not supported                                          | Supported                                                |
| **Speed**                 | Slower, but delivers complete data                     | Faster, but there is a risk of incomplete data delivery   |

## Project core


### How Do We Support Multiple Concurrent Connections?

This project employs a multithreaded architecture to facilitate multiple concurrent connections. Upon establishing a connection, each client is allocated a dedicated space on the server’s disk. This design ensures that each client operates independently, allowing the server to effectively manage simultaneous connections without interference. By leveraging threads, the server can handle multiple client requests in parallel, thereby enhancing the overall responsiveness and performance of the chat application.

### How Do Clients Achieve Communication with Each Other?

The communication process between clients is managed through a syntactical framework consisting of two primary functions. When a client intends to send a message, it is first formatted using the `stringify` function. This function prepares the message for transmission by converting it into a standardized format. Upon receipt of the message, the client employs a `parse` function to decompose the incoming data back into a comprehensible structure. 

An essential intermediary step occurs on the server, where it reads the incoming request to identify and verify the intended recipient of the message. The server's `client_handler` method plays a crucial role in this communication process. It assesses the input packet and determines the appropriate response or action to take based on the content and context of the message. This method ensures that the server effectively manages the flow of information between clients, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the communication channel.

### Protocol Syntax

Our message is build with the following structure:


```bnf
<protocol> ::= <MCP> / <VERSION> / <METHOD> / CODE:<STATUS_CODE> / <ADDITIONAL_DATA> / MSG: <message_text>

<MCP> ::= "MCP"
<VERSION> ::= <version_number>
<METHOD> ::= GET | JOIN | SEND | LEAVE
<STATUS_CODE> ::= 0 ... 404
<ADDITIONAL_DATA> ::= <KEY> ":" <VALUE> 
                   | "/" <ADDITIONAL_DATA> {1..9}
<message_text> ::= <text_content>
```


| Component        | Definition                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<protocol>`     | The full message format, composed of MCP, version, method, status code, additional data, and message. |
| `<MCP>`          | Constant string "MCP".                                                     |
| `<VERSION>`      | Version number, specified as `<version_number>`.                           |
| `<METHOD>`       | Defines the action: `GET`, `JOIN`, `SEND`, or `LEAVE`.                     |
| `<STATUS_CODE>`  | Status code ranging from `0` to `404`.                                     |
| `<ADDITIONAL_DATA>` | Key-value pairs or up to 10 additional data elements. Example: `key: value`. Each one separated by backslash. Possible values:|
||E_MTD:`<METHOD>`<br>|
| `<message_text>` | Actual text content of the message.                                        |

# Achievements and difficulties

The project managed to extinguish the little love we had left for education. It was something very basic at the telecommunications level, but the number of errors we encountered made it difficult. Starting with memory management errors in C, pointers, and SEGMENTATION FAULT, it became very challenging to work with programming at such a low level. Building the protocol from scratch meant thinking ahead about how we wanted the functionalities to grow, and since we didn't plan this well from the beginning, it changed many times. There are many functionalities we had in mind that were left unimplemented because time was limited; we spent more time fixing errors than creating functionalities.

Despite everything, we managed to get the clients to communicate with each other using the syntax we defined in each of their messages. Initially, only one message could be sent at a time, which made the order of messages very strange, with some disappearing and others getting stuck in the buffer. With the help of threads and queues, we were able to implement a chat that supports multiple messages in succession. The scalability of our protocol lies in the additionalData, which can receive a variety of data depending on the needs, although for this submission, we only specified the expected method to be returned.

We effectively achieved the simultaneous connection of several chat lines, and overall, we met the objectives.



# Conclusions


In conclusion, the development of the client-client chat system has successfully demonstrated the application of the telematics course concepts, especially in the implementation of the TCP/IP model. By using the Berkeley Sockets API for the transport layer and designing a custom protocol for the application layer, the project achieved its goals of creating a robust chat application capable of handling multiple concurrent connections. The choice of TCP over UDP ensured reliable and orderly message delivery, essential for efficient communication. In addition, the multithreaded architecture allows for independent client operations while maintaining a smooth exchange of messages through a structured protocol. Overall, the project highlights the importance of a solid architecture and protocol design in creating efficient communication systems.
